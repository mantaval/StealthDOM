# StealthDOM — Known Limitations & Applied Fixes

## Issue 1: `chrome.scripting.executeScript` Cannot Reach Cross-Frame Content

### Observed Behaviour
When navigating to Gmail's standalone compose URL (`https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?view=cm&...`), all DOM queries (`browser_evaluate`, `browser_query`, `browser_fill`, `browser_click`) return `null` or fail silently. Even `document.body` is `null`.

The page title is correctly retrieved via `chrome.tabs.get()`, proving the tab is loaded and the connection is alive — but script execution cannot find any elements.

### Root Cause
Gmail's `?view=cm` compose mode renders as a `<frameset>` document (no `<body>`). The actual UI lives inside nested `<frame>` elements. `chrome.scripting.executeScript` targets **only the top-level document** of the tab. It does not descend into `<frame>` or `<iframe>` elements from other origins.

The same issue affects any page that uses framesets or cross-origin iframes for its primary UI:
- Gmail standalone compose (`<frameset>`)
- Legacy web apps using framesets
- Embedded cross-origin iframes (e.g., payment widgets, OAuth dialogs)

### Fix Applied (v3.0.2)

Implemented a complete cross-frame solution in three layers:

1. **On-demand injection with `allFrames: true`** — Content scripts are injected lazily via `chrome.scripting.executeScript({ allFrames: true })` when the first command targets a tab (not declared in `manifest.json`). This injects into every `<frame>` and `<iframe>`, giving every frame native DOM query capabilities without requiring `eval()`, while saving memory on untouched tabs.

2. **`frameId` routing in `bridgeForwardToContentScript`** — The background script passes an optional `frameId` to `chrome.tabs.sendMessage()`, targeting a specific frame's content script. Without `frameId`, the top-level frame is targeted (backward compatible).

3. **`frame_id` parameter on all MCP DOM tools** — All 24 DOM reading and interaction tools (query, click, type, fill, hover, etc.) accept an optional `frame_id` parameter. Frame IDs are discovered via `browser_list_frames()`.

4. **`browser_list_frames(tab_id)`** — Enumerates every frame in a tab using `chrome.scripting.executeScript` with `allFrames: true`. Returns `{ frameIndex, frameId, url, title, hasBody, isFrameset, elementCount }` per frame.

5. **`browser_evaluate_all_frames(tab_id, code, world)`** — Executes arbitrary JS in ALL frames simultaneously, returning per-frame results with `frameIndex` and `frameId`. Includes Trusted Types fallback via `<script>` tag injection.

**Cross-frame workflow:** `browser_list_frames()` → find target `frameId` → pass `frame_id=N` to any DOM tool.

All tools are exposed as MCP tools and registered in the background script's command routing.

## Issue 2: `captureVisibleTab` Quota Errors on Rapid Screenshot Calls

### Observed Behaviour
When `browser_screenshot` or `browser_screenshot_full_page` is called in rapid succession (or retried after a failure), Chrome throws:
```
MAX_CAPTURE_VISIBLE_TAB_CALLS_PER_SECOND
```
The quota persists across failed attempts — even failed calls consume the quota bucket, making recovery difficult.

### Root Cause
Chrome's `chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab` API enforces a hard rate limit of ~2 calls/second per extension. Failed attempts still count against the limit. Parallel tool calls (e.g., attempting two screenshots simultaneously) immediately saturate the quota.

### Fix Applied (v3.0.1)
Added `captureWithRetry()` helper in `background.js` that catches quota errors and retries with exponential backoff (600ms base, 1.5× multiplier, 3s cap, 5 max attempts). This is live in the current codebase.

### Fix Applied (v3.0.2)
Added a Promise-based mutex (`_screenshotLock`) wrapping `captureWithRetry()`. The MCP layer previously had no awareness of quota state — parallel `browser_screenshot` calls would saturate the quota simultaneously. The mutex ensures only one `captureVisibleTab` call can be in-flight at a time; any parallel call awaits the lock. Combined with the v3.0.1 retry logic, this fully resolves the issue.

## Issue 3: Full-Page Screenshot Stack Overflow on Tall Pages

### Observed Behaviour
`browser_screenshot_full_page` throws `Maximum call stack size exceeded` on pages taller than ~3–4 viewports.

### Root Cause
The original base64 encoder used `String.fromCharCode.apply(null, largeUint8Array)` which passes the entire array as arguments to `apply()`. V8's call stack overflows at ~125,000 arguments. A 4-viewport-tall PNG easily exceeds this.

### Fix Applied (v3.0.1)
Replaced with a chunk-spread loop using chunks of 8,192 bytes — well under V8's argument limit, and orders of magnitude faster than a byte-by-byte loop. Live in current codebase.

## Issue 4: Window Focus Steal During Screenshots

### Observed Behaviour
`browser_screenshot` and `browser_screenshot_full_page` force the browser window to pop to the front of all OS windows. If the window was minimized, it stays maximized after the screenshot.

### Root Cause
Chrome's `captureVisibleTab` requires the target tab to be in an active, focused window. This is a hard browser limitation with no extension-level workaround.

### Fix Applied (v3.0.1)
Both screenshot functions now:
1. Record `targetWindow.state` before stealing focus
2. Re-minimize the window after capture if `wasMinimized === true`

The flash is still visible (~150ms) but the window returns to its previous state automatically.

### Future Option
See `docs/06_screenshot_approaches.md` for a full analysis of the `html2canvas` silent screenshot approach, which would eliminate the focus steal entirely at the cost of ~10% visual fidelity.

## Summary Table

| # | Issue | Status | Effort to Fix |
|---|-------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Cross-frame DOM access (`<frameset>`, iframes) | ✅ Fixed (v3.0.2) | Done — `browser_list_frames` + `browser_evaluate_all_frames` |
| 2 | `captureVisibleTab` quota errors | ✅ Fixed (v3.0.2) | Done — mutex + retry |
| 3 | Full-page screenshot stack overflow | ✅ Fixed | Done |
| 4 | Window focus steal during screenshots | ✅ Mitigated (restore) | See `06_screenshot_approaches.md` for full fix |

## All Issues Resolved

As of v3.0.2, all known issues are either fully fixed or mitigated with documented fallback paths. The only remaining enhancement opportunity is Issue 4's silent screenshot approach via `html2canvas` (documented in `docs/06_screenshot_approaches.md`).
